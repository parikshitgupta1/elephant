        <h1>God's Own Country! Really?</h1>
        
        <p>The heartbreaking death of a pregnant elephant in Kerala who was fed pineapple filled with crackers has sent shockwaves to people across the nation. While internet users are using social media to express their anger over the incident that took place in the fringe areas of the Silent Valley in Attapati, some of them even shared artworks to demand strong action against the ‘act of betrayal’. According to reports, the crackers exploded in the elephant’s mouth leaving her jaw injured and ultimately died while standing in river Velliyar.</p>
        
        <h2>‘Special place in hell’</h2>
          <p>The unidentified people behind the inhumane deed are being criticised by thousands on the internet. People shared posters, quotes, comics to express their anger and grief. Some of the artworks even displayed the unborn calf saying the humans are “nice” because they fed them food. </p>
        <h3>All i can say is:</h3>
          <p>There was trust, there was hope and there were two life's in one. As a man once said an elephant's eye can speak a thousand languages and all she said at that moment will be the pain she was suffering and the worries which shad had for her baby. And the baby's words would be "dear mom; i am hungry; i am thirsty , i can't feel the warmth, am I going to die...? And at the end of the day the question that remains is who is the beast? The Elephant or the Humans?</p>
        <p>Thats all!</p>
